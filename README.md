This is **N**ew **G**eneration of **Majordome**.

**Majordome** is a lightweight Automation System.
**Majordome** is event driven and use Lua as user script.

**Documentation is on way** with a very low priority : I may increase its priority if someone marks some interest on this tool.

In the mean time :
- You should have a look on **Config** sub directory for simple example of Majordome's scripts and configuration file.
- in **MaMaison** branch, you will have also a full working version of my house automation (in French).
