Within **Majordome**, your application is built around a galaxy of small tasks orchestrated by efficient but resource conservative mechanisms.<br>
You organize your code into independent and **stateless Lua functions** that are called when an event happened and/or conditions are met (*like what AWS Lambda does*). Tasks are executed only if necessary in the massively threaded Majordome engine, resulting to a as reduced as possible system footprint.


**Majordome** is using **MQTT** for message exchanges and **Lua** as user script.
