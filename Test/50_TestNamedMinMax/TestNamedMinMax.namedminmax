-- This is an example of Tracker script
-- In the header of the script (comment bloc at the very beginning of
-- the script), each line starting with -->> are Majordome's commands.
-- Consequently, '--->>' are commented out commands.
--
-- Name of this script
-- if not set, takes the filename
-- Notez-bien : if used, this directive MUST be defined before any
-- listen directive.
--->> name=Toto

-- remove some trace
-- This option is useful to avoid logging of very noisy topics
-->> quiet

-- Disable this trigger
--->> disabled

-- Indicate MQTT topic(s) to listen to
-- More than one "listen" can be present
-- In such case, it's wise for this function to return different name.
-->> listen=ConsPower
-->> listen=ProdPower
--
-->> need_topic=ConsPower
-->> need_topic=ProdPower

-- The function bellow has to return the name of the figure
-- (or nothing if the data has to be rejected)
-- As a second (optional) argument, it can force the value

-- Determine which data is it
if MAJORDOME_TOPIC == ConsPower:getTopic() then
	return "Consumer", MAJORDOME_PAYLOAD-1	-- The value is forced
elseif MAJORDOME_TOPIC == ProdPower:getTopic() then
	return "Producer"
