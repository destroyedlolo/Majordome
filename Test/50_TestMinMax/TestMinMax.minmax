-- In the header of the script (comment bloc at the very beginning of
-- the script), each line starting with -->> are Majordome's commands.
-- Consequently, '--->>' are commented out commands.
--
-- Name of this script
-- if not set, takes the filename
-- Notez-bien : if used, this directive MUST be defined before any
-- listen directive.
--->> name=Toto

-- This option is useful to avoid logging of very noisy topics
-->> quiet

-- Disable this trigger
--->> disabled
--
-- Indicate MQTT topic(s) to listen to
-- More than one "listen" can be present : in such case, all
-- incomming data are considered in the same minmax
-->> listen=ConsPower

-- Bellow, optional Lua code to validate the data (MAJORDOME_PAYLOAD variable) :
-- - if the return code is 'false', the data is ignored
-- - other value, or no return, the data is considered

for k,v in pairs(_G)
do
	print(k,v)
