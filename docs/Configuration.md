Majordome's configuration
=========================

This little page explaines how to configure **Majordome**.<br>
Some examples are provided also in `Config` directory at the root of this project.

# Majordome command line options

## General options
- `-h` : onling helps about known options (mostly what is bellow)
- `-f` : specify Majordome's configuration file. If not provided, the default it `/usr/local/etc/Majordome.conf`
- `-t` : tests configuration file and exits. Ensures your configuration is syntax correct and understood as you're expecting by Majordome.

## Verbosity
- `-q` : be quiet, remove all messages but script generated ones
- `-v` : enable verbose messages
- `-r` : enable trace messages, even more verbose, noisy
- `-V` : silence topic arrival messages. Avoid verbosity to be polluted but incoming messages tracking which is very noisy.
